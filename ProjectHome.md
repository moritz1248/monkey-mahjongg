Monkey Mahjongg is a 3D mahjongg implementation using jMonkeyEngine. While it should run stand-alone and make fun, the main purpose is to show a simple but complete game implementation, which can serve as demo and example (including a tutorial), so it should be kept small and simple. Finally the code should become part of the jmetest package, however this site will provide stand-alone downloads.

Of course, there will be some references to the "fauna and flora" around jME, which includes monkeys, frogs, lamas...

08/24/2008: Code base switched to jMonkeyEngine 2, which is not backward compatible. Please use tag jme1 to check out the last revision for jME version 1. A new zip download for jME2 is planned as well, but this will take some time.
